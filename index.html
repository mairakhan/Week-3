      <p class="bioText">I am an Architect, currently pursuing Master of Urban Planning degree at the <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/">Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation</a> at Columbia University, New York. The focus of my degree is on environmental planning and data analytics. My ongoing graduate thesis explores the potentials of global Flood Vulnerability Indices and their relevance and applicability in local communities. 
      I am currently working as an environmental planning intern at <a href="http://www.phaeng.com/">Philip Habib and Associates</a> where my job is to assist in conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) of major rezoning projects in New York City. In the past I have worked as an urban design and planning intern at the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/about/department.page">New York City Department of City Planning</a>, Manhattan Office and as an architectural designer at Genesis Architectural Consultancy. In addition to my experience in urban planning and architecture as a practitioner, I have also taught urban design at undergrad level at the Department of Architecture, <a href="http://www.pu.edu.pk/">University of the Punjab</a> in Pakistan for three years.</p>
