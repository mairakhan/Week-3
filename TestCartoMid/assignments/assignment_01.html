      <h1>ASSIGNMENT 01 - CIRCULAR COLUMN CHARTS</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="bio">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText">Circular Column Chart is one type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">Pie Charts</a> showing in 3D perspective. A circular column chart (or a pie chart) is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented.</p>
      <p class="bioText">A circular column chart, or perspective pie cake, is used to give the chart a 3D look. Often used for aesthetic reasons, the third dimension does not improve the reading of the data; on the contrary, these plots are difficult to interpret because of the distorted effect of perspective associated with the third dimension. The use of superfluous dimensions not used to display the data of interest is discouraged for charts in general, not only for pie charts.</p>

      <h2>Types of Data</h2>
      <p class="bioText">This type of chart is suitable for showing both the percentage and the amount of each parts. It's useful to show two types of information simutasimultaneously.
      <h2>Advantages</h2>
      <p class="bioText">Use as one cataglory statistics to see the percentage of each parcel.</p>
      <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
      <p class="bioText">Statisticians generally regard pie charts as a poor method of displaying information, and they are uncommon in scientific literature. One reason is that it is more difficult for comparisons to be made between the size of items in a chart when area is used instead of length and when different items are shown as different shapes. In this reason, the circular column chart also have limitation in comparison.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p class="bioText">The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair">William Playfair's</a> Statistical Breviary of 1801, in which two such graphs are used. Playfair presented an illustration, which contained a series of pie charts. One of those charts depicting the proportions of the Turkish Empire located in Asia, Europe and Africa before 1789. This invention was not widely used at first;</p>
      <p class="bioText">The French engineer Charles Joseph Minard was one of the first to use pie charts in 1858, in particular in maps. Minard's map, 1858 used pie charts to represent the cattle sent from all around France for consumption in Paris (1858).Playfair thought that pie charts were in need of a third dimension to add additional information. It has been said that Florence Nightingale invented it, though in fact she just popularised it and she was later assumed to have created it due to the obscurity of Playfair's creation.</p>
